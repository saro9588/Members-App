## Overview
This is an Application that I am developing for my business. I run a private music studio and this app will help store my students data and update them over time. â€¨
This app can serve other types of users as well. You can create a user, store specific info about each user, update the info of each user. 

## Improvements 
1)Set up the user login. 
2)Improve Prisma Schema Model to store info related to each user after being created, this info is different from the initially set set of notes. 
3)Improve the landing page UI. 


## Built with
React. 
NextJS.
TypeScript.
Prisma backend.
MySql.
