## Overview
This is an Application that I am developing for my business. I run a private music studio and this app will help me create student portfolios, update and delete them. â€¨
This app can serve other types of users as well. You can create a user, store specific info about each user, update the info of each user. 

## Improvements 
1) UI error handling upon logging in with an invalid user/password. 
2) Add user authorization: secure API endpoints.

## Built with
React. 
NextJS.
TypeScript.
Prisma & PostgreSQL.
MySql.
